## Introduction

Here you'll find a collection of extensions I've created for [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com), a productivity tool I love using.

## Installation

To install any of the extensions, simply search for them in the Raycast Store. You can visit my [Raycast Profile](https://www.raycast.com/YourMCGeek) to see all of my published extensions.

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install the extensions manually, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourMCGeek/raycast-extensions.git
    ```

2. Open Raycast and use the `Import Extension` command.
3. Navigate to the cloned repository and select the extension you want to import.

That's it! The extension should now be available in Raycast.

## Usage

Each extension has its own set of instructions. Check out the README file in each extension's directory for detailed usage information.

## Contributing

    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

3. Make your changes and commit them:
